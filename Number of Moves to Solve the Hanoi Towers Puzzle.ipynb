    "well known Hanoi Towers puzzle. In this puzzle, we're given three sticks. Two of them are initially empty. On the first stick, we have n discs, sorted by size as shown here on the slide. Our goal is to move all n discs to some other stick, to one of the two empty sticks. This would be easy if not given two constraints. First of all, we are allowed to move only one disc at a time, and naturally we need to take the top most disc from one stick, and to put it to some other stick, right? And also we are not allowed to put a larger disc onto a smaller disc, okay? So the question is whether it is possible for, and if it is possible, then for which values of n this is possible, okay? So it is known to be possible for every value of n."
